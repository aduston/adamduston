# Product Design: SchoolOS

In this post we design a mobile/web product for public schools, public school students, and the students' parents.

## Experience

### Parents' Perspective

#### Daily notification

I'm a parent. At the end of each day at exactly the same time (3 pm, in my case), I receive a notification on my phone:

*Image here: "Alex's school day is over. "*

I can click on this image to see a few things about my child's day:

*Image here: homework for day, reminders for next day (with option to go further), score for the day, schedule for day, one thing I can discuss at dinner (in the form of a photo), any photos of my kid or my kid's class*

There are a few other pages that are available, in case the parent wants to see them:

#### This quarter's syllabus

#### Upcoming events (calendar)

#### Donate something

#### Weekly schedule

#### Message board for parents
