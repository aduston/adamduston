    "# Problem 1\n",
    "There are two inputs, a list of synonyms and a list of query pairs. For each query pair, determine equivalence given the list of synonyms.\n",
    "\n",
    "The synonym list is always provided as a list of pairs of strings. For any word with synonyms, all pairs appear in the list (so there's no need to follow transitive relationships). Synonyms might consist of one word or several, and it's possible for one term to have several different synonyms.\n",

    "[(\"read\", \"look through\"), (\"The Iliad\", \"The Song of Ilium\"), (\"look\", \"see\")]\n",

    "## Dynamic Programming Formulation\n",
    "### \"Build the grid\"\n",
    "Each query is tokenized by splitting on white space to yield a list of words. For a query `a`, define `a[i]` as the ith word of `a` and `a[i:j]` as the tuple of ith through j-1th (inclusive) words of `a`, of length `j - i`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a given query pair `(a, b)`, define `M[i, j]` to be True if there is equivalence between `a` and `b` up to `a[i - 1]` and `b[j - 1]`, and False otherwise. Then:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "M[0, 0] = True\n",
    "M[i, j] = ∃ k < i, l < j s.t. M[k, l] is True and a[k:i] is a synonym of b[l:j]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A query pair `(a, b)` is equivalent if and only if `M[len(a), len(b)]` is True.\n",
    "\n",
    "This yields a straightforward dynamic programming solution in which a 2-d grid is built with word `a` on the horizontal axis and `b` on the vertical axis. One column is devoted to each word of `a` and one row to each word of `b`. Given the indexing given above, we append one extra column and one extra row. Each cell `(i, j)` contains the value True to indicate there is equivalence between `a` and `b` up to `a[i - 1]` and `b[j - 1]`, and False otherwise. In the solution below, we only keep track of the grid coordinates containing True, since they're the only ones that matter in the above recursive formulation of `M[i, j]`."
