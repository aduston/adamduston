    "# The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have a coin that lands heads with probability $p$ and tails with probability $q = p - 1$, and which has no memory between flips (meaning successive flips are stochastically independent). What are the chances of seeing two consecutive heads in n coin flips?\n",

    "Each path has a weight equal to its probability. Since successive trials are stochastically independent, each branch leading to an H has a weight of p and each branch leading to a T has a weight of q.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although we're trying to determine the probability of two consecutive heads in n flips, it's arguably easier to characterize its complement, the probability of *not* getting two consecutive heads in n flips. Suppose that, as of the kth flip, we have not yet seen two consecutive heads. The kth flip can be either a head or a tail. Suppose it's a head; in this case the the k-1st flip must have been a tail. So the first k flips must end either in TH or T, of probability $pq$ and $q$, respectively. Denoting the probability of not getting two consecutive heads as of flip k as $a_k$, we then have $a_k = pqa_{k-2} + qa_{k-1}$.\n",
